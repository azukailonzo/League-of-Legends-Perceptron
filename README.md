# League-of-Legends-Perceptron
Implemented a perceptron model in order to predict the top 3 most important features from the first 10 minutes of the League of Legends game.
(with the help of two other students).

Running the file:
-To run the Perceptron.py file, use an IDE such as PyCharm. All you would need to do is open the file, 
and click the green run button.

Runtime:
-The code should not take too long to run with the number of epochs set at 100. 
 To run the file to complete and print out statistics, it will probably take no
 more than 5 minutes.

Libraries:
-pandas, numpy, sklearn.preprocessing : StandardScaler, sklearn.model_selection : train_test_split,
 sklearn.linear_model : Perceptron
